# word-chain-challenge


## The Challenge
Given a list of words, construct a chain of words where each word in the chain has each of the previous word's letters, plus one more.  For example:
* no
* one
* tone
* teton

...would be a chain of four words.  Note that the letter order does not matter.  In 'no', the n is before the o, in 'one', the o is before the n.

Code an algorithm that will find the longest chain of words possible, given the list of words in the following input file, in as efficient a manner as possible.

## Input
The following word list should be used as the input to your program.  The file should be read from disk as a part of your program so that alternative word lists can also be used in our evaluation of your solution.  Do not crat a solution specific to t*this* word list.

## Output
The time that your solution took to reach its conclusion, in milliseconds, as well as the longest chain of words that your solution found.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be judged by its accuracy, efficiency (i.e. speed), readability, and maintainability.
